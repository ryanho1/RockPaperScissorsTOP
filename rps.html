<!-- 
the problem is rock paper scissors
how do I code a rock paper scissors
player and computer

player inputs into something
then computer logs it, then reacts to it with its own randomized "r", "p", or "s"

then whoever wins
Paper > Rock
Scissors > Paper
Rock > Scissors

then the winner gets added

then there will be a button for "new game"


will have an area to CHOOSE Rock Paper or Scissors
Then it will have a "Battle" button

winner gets printed

Then a restart button

PSEUDOCODE
user chooses rock paper or scissors
computer then randomly choose rps
computer compares through IF then statements
then computer spits out results & a "new game button"
